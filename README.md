# America is a mod for Cities Skylines 2

Currently this only disables government subsidies. In future it might even be negative, to simulate federal taxes etc.

Plan is to make game harder, it just so happens, that simulating America is the easiest way to do it.

Other ideas include: limit amount of wind power, e.g. you can have only 1 wind turbine per 10000 people or something? Fiddle with other income sources...
